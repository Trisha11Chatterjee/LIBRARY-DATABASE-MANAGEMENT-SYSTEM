# LIBRARY-DATABASE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

This code defines a database structure for a library management system, with tables for members, books, borrow transactions, late payments, and equipment. It includes creating tables with appropriate primary and foreign key relationships, inserting data, and performing various queries and updates.

In general, all SELECT statements in your SQL script are used to query data from different tables of the library management system, either to view the entire dataset (*), filter results using WHERE, or aggregate information (such as wages in the STAFF table). These queries are primarily used to fetch and display data for further analysis or reporting.
